* Desc: Psuedo-code for speed conversion from km/sec to miles/hour
*/

 Start;
 Speed in km/sec; // Input
 speed in miles/hour= (speed in km/sec * 0.621371)*3600; // formula for speed conversion
 Speed in miles/hour; // Output
 stop;

My Approach towards this question:
So, we were given the scenerio of designing a program that can covert the speed in miles/hour from km/sec, I asked for for speed in km/sec and converted into miles/hour by applying the formula. And i ended up on this solution
