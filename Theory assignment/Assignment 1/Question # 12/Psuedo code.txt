*/

 Start;
 Input jugs 3L and 4L;
 Fill the 5L jug completely;
 Pour the 5L jug into 3L jug until full;
 Empty the 3L jug;
 Pour the remaining 2L from 5L jug into 3L jug;
 Again fill the 5L jug completely;
 Pour from 5L jug into 3L jug until full;
 You are left with 4L of water in 5L jug;
 Stop;


My Approach:
It was basically an IQ based question where i had to do some logical thinking and separate 4L of water to defuse the bomb so, i did some basic calculation and achieved the required result.
