 Start;
 Digit, number,sum;  //Declarig variable
 sum=0;  // Intializing sum=0
 Input any number;
 While(number>0){  // applying while 
     digit= numer % 10;
     sum= sum + digit;
     number= number/10;
 } // End while-loop
 print sum;
Stop;


My Approach:
My approach towards this question was to first separate the digits of the number that i did by using integer division and modular operator and then add the digits to obtain the sum.
