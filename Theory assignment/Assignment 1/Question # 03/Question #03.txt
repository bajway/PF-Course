 Start

 While(Province==punjab){
    if(gender==M){
    if(age>=18){
        Display eligible for marriage} // End if
    } //End if
 else{ 
  age>=16;
  Display You are eligible for marriage }// End else
  }// End while
 While(Provnice== sindh){
   if( age>=18){
   Display You are eligible for marriage; } // End if
   else{
   Display you are underage; } // End else

 while(Province!=sindh || Province!= punjab){
   Display Record not found; } //End while
 Stop;

My approach towards this question:
