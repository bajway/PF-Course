Start;
Input ride, age, height; // ride--->string; age,height--->integer
if(ride== The dragon roller coaster && ride==The sky swing && ride== The carousel){
 for dragon roller coaster:
//height is in inches and age in years
 if (age>=10 && height>=48){
	print "You are eligible for dragon coaster ride";
 }
else{
print "You are not eligible for dragon coaster ride";
}

 for The sky swing:
 if ( height>=54){
	print "You are eligible for The sky swing ride";
 }
else{
print "You are not eligible for The sky swing ride";
}

 for The carousel:
 if (age>=5){
	print "You are eligible for The carousel ride";
 }
else{
print "You are not eligible for The carousel ride";
}
} //End if
else{
print "Ride not found! Try again";
} //End else
Stop;

My Approach:
At first i applied condition for checking available rides and then applied conditions for particular ride such as age and height, and displayed the eligibility for the ride.
