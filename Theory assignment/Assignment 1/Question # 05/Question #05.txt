My approach towards this question:
In this question i applied multiple conditions just to arrive at the desired outcome as i was to design a program that controls a drone that helps in irigation, first thing i did was checked the condition for the crops. Secondly, checked conditions required for irrigation seperately and after doing a bunch of calculation an working i ended up with this solution. :)
