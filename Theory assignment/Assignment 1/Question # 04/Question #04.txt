My approach towards this question:
I was asked to design a calculator for Mr. Bhola that could help him in the shopping as he keeps on forgetting so i did my maths and multiplied the quantity with the price of item and stored that into grand total with all other fuits, i also applied a condition at the checkout, and finally displayed the grand total and the change Bhola had received.
