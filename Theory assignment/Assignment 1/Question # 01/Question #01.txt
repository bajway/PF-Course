*/

 Start;
 Speed in km/sec; // Input
 speed in miles/hour= (speed in km/sec * 0.621371)*3600; // formula for speed conversion
 Speed in miles/hour; // Output
 stop;


My approach towards this question:
This question felt like starter as we were given a scenerio of simply coverting speed in km/sec to miles per hour
