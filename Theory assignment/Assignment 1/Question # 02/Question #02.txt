 Start;
 Input number;
  while(number>0){
    if(number%2==0){
         Display even number;
    }// End if
 else{
    Display odd number;
   } // End else
  } //End while
  if(number<=0){
    Display invalid input;
   } // End if
 Stop;

My Approach towards this question:
I was given the scenerio of finding if a number is even or odd, i did my calculations and applied necessary conditions and ended up with this solution.
